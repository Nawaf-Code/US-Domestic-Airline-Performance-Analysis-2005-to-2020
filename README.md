# US Domestic Airline Flights Performance Analysis

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing and visualizing US domestic airline flights' performance. The project aims to monitor and report the airline's performance to improve flight reliability and customer reliability.

## Key Report Items

- Yearly Airline Performance Report: This report provides insights into the airline's performance on a yearly basis, including metrics like on-time performance, cancellation rates, and customer satisfaction.

- Yearly Average Flight Delay Statistics: This report focuses on analyzing the average flight delay statistics for the airline between 2005 and 2020.

## Code Description

The project is implemented in Python using various libraries such as Pandas, Dash, Plotly Graph Objects, and Plotly Express.

## Data Source

The airline data is sourced from the following URL: https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/airline_data.csv .

## Functionality

The project offers an interactive web application created with Dash, allowing users to choose between two types of reports:
1. Yearly Airline Performance Report
2. Yearly Airline Delay Report

Users can also select a specific year within the range of 2005 to 2020 for data visualization.
